## Description

My portfolio, created with React and deployed on GitHub Pages. I drew heavily from the code from my last portfolio; in the future I intend to reorganize the file structure of my pages and components to mirror how most React apps are structured in a professional environment.

In addition, the app includes a "contact me" form; however this isn't functional yet. I'll need to come back to this and work on it soon. In the meantime, use the provided email and phone links!

## Credits

This app was developed using VS code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Libraries and packages that were used to create this app:
React: https://reactjs.org/
Several FontAwesome icons: https://fontawesome.com/
Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
gh-pages: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages

Trey Eckels and the instructional staff at the boot camp I'm attending (GA Tech's Full Stack Web Dev course) were incredible, and without them I wouldn't have the skills to develop this app.
